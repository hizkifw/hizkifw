# Hey there! I'm Felix ðŸ‘‹

I love building random tools and web apps. Some of the things I've built:

- [fc2-live-dl](https://github.com/HoloArchivists/fc2-live-dl) â€” automatically download live streams from fc2
- [hoshinova](https://github.com/HoloArchivists/hoshinova) â€” automatically download live streams from youtube
- [notes.vercel.app](https://notes.vercel.app) â€” offline in-browser notepad
- [bitcoin.vercel.app](https://bitcoin.vercel.app) â€” bitcoin price tracker

There's more but a lot of them are either unfinished or private. My usual tech stack consists of Next.js, Typescript, and Golang, but recently I've been dabbling with Rust, building projects such as:

- [discord-oidc](https://gitlab.com/aonahara/discord-oidc) â€” use discord as an openid connect identity provider
- [tempbin](https://github.com/hizkifw/tempbin) â€” pastebin but you can also upload files and paste images
