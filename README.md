# Hey there! I'm Felix 👋

I love building random tools and web apps. Some of the things I've built:

- [ragtag archive](https://github.com/ragtag-archive) — archive of vtuber streams, with youtube-like interface
- [fc2-live-dl](https://github.com/HoloArchivists/fc2-live-dl) — automatically download live streams from fc2
- [hoshinova](https://github.com/HoloArchivists/hoshinova) — automatically download live streams from youtube
- [gex!](https://github.com/hizkifw/gex) — tui hex editor written in go
- [notes.vercel.app](https://notes.vercel.app) — offline in-browser notepad

There's more but a lot of them are either unfinished or private. My usual tech stack consists of Next.js, Typescript,
and Golang, but recently I've been dabbling with Rust, building projects such as:

- [discord-oidc](https://gitlab.com/aonahara/discord-oidc) — use discord as an openid connect identity provider
- [tempbin](https://github.com/hizkifw/tempbin) — pastebin but you can also upload files and paste images

## Anyway here's some stats
